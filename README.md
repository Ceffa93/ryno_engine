The **Ryno Engine** is a toy game engine I developed during university to learn C++ and graphics programming.
Looking back at it, it is a very naive project, but it has great sentimental value :) 

A trailer showcasing the features of the engine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnq0vhDVh8U
During the development I kept an online diary, updated daily with screenshots: http://rynoengine.blogspot.it
